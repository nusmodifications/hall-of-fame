Hall of Fame
==

Search engine for NUS awardees. All data is obtained from long running publicly available sources from NUS websites.
Currently only limited to Business, Enginering and Computing because these are the only faculties who publicly released their awards listings.

The truth is, Medicine and Law do put up their awardees too, but since they do not use NUSMods, we have less inclination to build something that serves them.

## Getting Started
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Visit `localhost:8080` in your web browser.
